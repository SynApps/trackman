Description:
    Generates a controller which will scaffold your maintenance pages when you execute the corresponding actions.
    The controller will also handle your 404 and 500 error pages. 
Usage:
    Pass the name of the controller as the first argument. If no name is specified
    it will take "errors" as default.

Examples:
    rails generate trackman:controller abc

        Will create a controller called "abc". It will contain four GET methods to
        access your error pages and generate your static pages.
