  # ContentSaver defines two class methods for filtering the ouput of your pages
  #
  # Note that it uses nokogiri to parse the output.
  # You can call the methods multiples times if you need, it will stack the calls.
  
  # edit selector, &block 
  # pass a css or xpath selector and a block that will get executed for each result 
  
  # ie:
  # edit "//link[contains(@src 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'))" do |node|
  #   node['src'] = "http://www.production.com"
  # end

  # remove selector[, &predicate]
  # pass a css or xpath selector. You can also pass an optional predicate 
  # to refine the scan instead of trying to make the perfect selector.
  
  # ie:
  # remove 'script' do |node|
  #   node['src'].include?('/assets') && !node['src'].include?('application')
  # end
